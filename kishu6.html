<h1>MAJOR WARS AND VICTORIY OF INDIA</h1>
<h2 class="hk6">First Indo-Pak War 1947</h2>
<img class="imgk6" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Indian_soldiers_fighting_in_1947_war.jpg"alt="">
<p>This is also called the First Kashmir War. The war started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the Maharajah of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu would accede to India. Following partition, states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a predominantly Muslim population
     ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal forces with support from the army
      of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharajah
       to sign the Agreement to the accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India
        to get Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed the Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948
        . The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal
         cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949. 379 India gained control of about
          two-third of the state (including Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly
           a third of Kashmir (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan). Most neutral assessments, agree that
            India was the victor of the war as it was able to conquer about two-third of the Kashmir including
             Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh.</p>
<h2 class="hk6">Operation Polo</h2>
<img class="imgk6"src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-58165139,imgsize-295680,width-400,resizemode-4/58165139.jpg"alt="">

<p>After the war with Pakistan, India turned its attention to the independent Hyderabad State. India perceived the nearby independent Muslim state
     and potential Pakistani ally as a threat. In a five-day operation, India reconquered and annexed Hyderabad.</p>
<h2 class="hk6">Invasion of Goa</h2>
<img class="imgk6" src="https://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/goa.jpg"alt="">
<p>In 1961 tension rose between India and Portugal over the Portuguese-occupied territory of Goa, which India claimed for itself. After Portuguese police cracked down violently on a peaceful, unarmed demonstration for union with India,
     the Indian government decided to reconquer. A lopsided air, sea, and ground campaign resulted in the speedy surrender of Portuguese forces. Within 36 hours, 451 years of Portuguese colonial rule was ended, and Goa was annexed by India.
     Portuguese losses were 34 killed, 57 wounded, and 3,306 captured. Indian losses were 22 killed and 51 wounded.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hk6">Second Indo Pak War, 1965</h2>
    <img class="imgk6"src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/oldbucket/715_-/mainnational/IndiaTv1d918f_1965.jpg"alt="">
    <p>This war started following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir 
        to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan.
         The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and also witnessed the largest tank battle since World War II.
          The hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet 
          Union and USA and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Though ruled to be militarily inconclusive, both India and
           Pakistan claimed victory. Most neutral assessments, however, agree that India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire
            was declared. As Pakistan lost more territory than it gained during the war and failed to achieve its goal of capturing Kashmir,
             many impartial observers have viewed the result as a defeat for Pakistan and an Indian strategic victory.</p>
<h2 class="hk6">Indo-Sino Conflict of 1967</h2> 

<img class="imgk6"src="https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-76041971,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-75/pic.jpg"alt="">
<p>The 1967 Sino-Indian skirmish also known as the Cho La incident (1 – 10 October 1967) was a military conflict between India and China in the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim, then an Indian protectorate. The Chinese People's Liberation Army infiltrated Sikkim on 1 October 1967, but was repulsed by the Indian Army by 10 October.
     During the Cho La and Nathu La incidents, Indian losses were 88 killed in action and 163 wounded, while Chinese casualties were 340 killed in action and 450 wounded.

    The end of the battle saw the Chinese Army forced to leave Sikkim after being defeated by Indian troops.</p>
<h2 class="hk6">Third Indo pak war ,1971 </h2>
<img class="imgk6"src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201903/1971_war_0.png?IK4ZPBqKchyc23GDRVSkD9KVqisaNyLU"alt="">
<p>This war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle between Sheikh Mujib, Leader of East Pakistan and Yahya-Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan brewing in erstwhile East Pakistan culminating in the declaration of Independence of Bangladesh from the state system of Pakistan. Following Operation Searchlight and the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India. India intervened in the ongoing Bangladesh liberation movement. After a large scale pre-emptive strike by Pakistan, full-scale hostilities between the two countries commenced.

    Pakistan attacked at several places along India's western border with Pakistan, but the Indian Army successfully held their positions. The Indian Army quickly responded to the Pakistan Army's movements in the west and made some initial gains, including capturing around 5,795 square miles (15,010 km2) of Pakistan territory (land gained by India in Pakistani Kashmir, Pakistani Punjab and Sindh sectors but gifted it back to Pakistan in the Simla Agreement of 1972, as a gesture of goodwill). Within two weeks of intense fighting, Pakistani forces in East Pakistan surrendered to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces following which the People's Republic of Bangladesh was created. This war saw the highest number of casualties in any of the India-Pakistan conflicts, as well as the largest number of prisoners of war since the Second World War after the surrender of more than 90,000 Pakistani military and civilians. In the words of one Pakistani author, "Pakistan lost half its navy, a quarter of its air force and a third of its army".</p>
<h2 class="hk6">Siachen War,1984</h2>
<img class="imgk6"src="https://www.jagranjosh.com/imported/images/E/Articles/siachen-life-soldiers.jpg"alt="">
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Pakistan began organising tourist expeditions on the Siachen Glacier, disputed territory 
    with India. Irked by this development, in April 1984 India initiated successful Operation Meghdoot during which it gained control over 
    all of the Siachen Glacier. India has established control over all of the 70 kilometres (43 mi) long Siachen Glacier and all of its 
    tributary glaciers, as well as the three main passes of the Saltoro Ridge immediately west of the glacier—Sia La, Bilafond La, and Gyong
     La.[79][80] According to TIME magazine, India gained more than 1,000 square miles (3,000 km2) of territory because of its military 
     operations in Siachen.[81] It still maintains a military base there. Pakistan tried in 1987 and in 1989 to re-take the glacier but was 
     unsuccessful. The conflict ended with Indian Victory. Ceasefire since 2003</p>
<h2 class="hk6">Kargil War</h2>
<img class="imgk6"src="https://m.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2018/07/07/Pictures/kargil-war_c5187088-818b-11e8-9920-75f90a7836bc.jpg"alt="">
<p>Commonly known as the Kargil War, or Operation Vijay in India, this conflict between the two countries was mostly limited. During early 1999, Pakistani troops infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) and occupied Indian territory mostly in the Kargil district. India responded by launching a 
    major military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators. Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached by the infiltrators. According to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.
     Fearing large-scale escalation in military conflict, the international community, led by the United States, increased diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to withdraw forces from remaining Indian territory. Faced with the possibility of international isolation, the already
      fragile Pakistani economy was weakened further. The morale of Pakistani forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties.[91][92] The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers, an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas. Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Nawaz Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation and that Pakistan had lost the conflict. By the end of July 1999, organized hostilities in the Kargil district had ceased and Kargil War finally came to end with a decisive Indian military and diplomatic victory.</p>
